DamageStats

Displays statistics related to damage in the upper right corner of the screen.

Note that the raw damage output of a weapon, projectile, punch, etc. does not necessarily mean that the health of the enemy is decreased by that amount. The final decrease in health factors in resistances, weaknesses, parries, etc. 

This mod displays the final change in health as 'dHealth', and the base damage output of a given weapon as 'dmg'.

Both of these numbers should allow you to get the full picture of what is happening.

The number of lines in the log, as well as the UI scale, is configurable.

Happy tech-hunting!
